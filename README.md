“Health is the greatest gift, contentment the greatest wealth, faithfulness the best relationship.” – Buddha

## Introduction

In a country as diverse and populous as India, access to healthcare remains a significant challenge, especially for underprivileged communities. These communities often face barriers such as limited access to doctors, lack of healthcare facilities, and financial constraints. Our mission is to bridge this gap by providing accessible healthcare advice to those who need it the most.

## Problem Statement

How can we provide accessible healthcare advice to underprivileged communities with limited access to doctors?

## Our Solution

We aim to create a website that will use AI with our custom RAG model to understand the problems of the patient and understand what hes suffering from. Then the AI would generate a concise summary of the patient, that any doctor can quickly review(summaries enable the doctor to accelerate disgnosis of the patient by a factor of 10-20x). then the doctor can approve the summary and write the prescription for the patient, which the patient can then see and buy the medicines. Future scope of this project would also help the patient find them pharmacy nearest to them.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Health Website**:  
  A responsive and interactive website that asks users a series of health-related questions. Based on their responses, the system:  
  - Generates a summary of their problems.  
  - Identifies three probable issues.  
  - Sends the information to the doctor via the portal.

- **Doctor Portal Integration**:  
  Doctors can review the summaries and probable issues, provide a probable diagnosis, and suggest medicines or further guidelines as needed.

- **Telemedicine Services**:  
  Enabling remote consultations to offer personalized medical advice and support.

## Impact

By implementing this solution, we aim to:

- Improve access to healthcare for underprivileged communities.
- Reduce the burden on overworked healthcare facilities.
- Promote preventive care and health education.
- Empower communities with the knowledge and resources to take control of their health.

## Get Involved

We invite healthcare professionals, technology experts, and volunteers to join us in this mission. Together, we can make a difference and ensure that everyone, regardless of their socio-economic status, has access to the healthcare they deserve.
